  Issue: User reported failed backup on 2025-06-23

  Date: 2025-06-23
  Simulated by: TheWrightBrother (via WSL Ubuntu)


🛠️   Actions Taken:

1. Checked `/var/log/syslog` for recent backup-related entries
2. Found error logged at `2025-06-23 18:52:03`:

   > "BACKUP FAILURE: rsync error on /home/user1"
3. Analyzed error message indicating possible rsync failure due to path or permission issues
4. Verified write permissions and configuration settings (simulated analysis)
5. Did *not* modify any configuration or file permissions — diagnostic stage only



🧠 Outcome:
Backup failure confirmed via syslog analysis. Root cause likely related to rsync configuration or insufficient write permissions on `/home/user1`. No changes made yet.



📋   Recommendation:
Investigate and correct rsync configuration files and ensure the backup user has proper write access to  /home/user1. After adjustments, re-run the backup and monitor logs for errors.

✅   Status: Diagnostic complete – ready for fix implementation or escalation.
