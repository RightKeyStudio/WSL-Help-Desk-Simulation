Date: 2025-06-24
Simulated by: TheWrightBrother (via WSL Ubuntu)



🛠️ Actions Taken:

1. Created a shell script using echo and redirection
2. Attempted to execute with ./backup.sh - received "Permission denied"
3. Verified permissions with: ls -l backup.sh → file was not executable
4. Resolved by running: chmod +x backup.sh
5. Confirmed script now executes and outputs: "Backup complete."



📋 Recommendation:
Educate user on Linux file permissions: read, write, execute.
Encourage safe use of `chmod` to avoid security risks.

✅ Status: Resolved.
