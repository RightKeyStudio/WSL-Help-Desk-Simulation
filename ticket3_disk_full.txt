Ticket ID: #003  
Issue: User reported disk full error - unable to save or update files.

Date: 2025-06-24  
Simulated by: TheWrightBrother (via WSL Ubuntu)




🛠️ Actions Taken:

1. Ran `df -h` - confirmed root partition usage was critically high
2. Used `sudo du -sh /*` to identify which directories were consuming the most space
3. Determined that `/var` was among the largest folders
4. Ran `sudo du -ah /var | sort -hr | head -n 20` to pinpoint the largest files inside `/var`
5. Did **not** remove files or clean system directories - analysis only



🧠 Outcome:
Diagnosis completed successfully. Disk usage confirmed and root cause identified (large files in `/var`), but no deletion or cleanup actions taken.



📋 Recommendation:
Next steps would involve safely cleaning large logs and running `sudo apt clean`, followed by verifying disk usage again with `df -h`.

✅ Status: Diagnostic complete - ready for cleanup or escalation.
